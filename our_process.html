      <h2>Stepping Stones</h2>
      <img src="assets/photos/progress-1.png">
      <p>Our first step in the process is to establish a well-defined plan that suits your needs. We will break down
        your income, net income, and all of your spending from top to bottom to ensure that no corner is left unturned,
        and the full potential of your money can be reached.

        For this, we will need integer values regarding your:
        ○ Location
        ○ Current Work Field
        ○ Target Quality Of Life
        ○ income
        ○ Net Income
      </p>

      <img src="assets/photos/progress-2.png">
      <p>In the next phase, you, as the consumer, will be heavily involved in completing various tasks assigned by,
        "EcoMinder" to reduce your expenses. This may include cancelling subscription fees and other similar expenses.
        It is crucial to adapt your lifestyle during this phase and take proactive steps towards achieving successful
        results.</p>

      <img src="assets/photos/progress-3.png">
      <p>At this stage, you can finally start enjoying the rewards of your hard work. This will involve several weeks or
        even months of carefully tracking your spending, which will be recorded and monitored by EcoMinder. You will
        also be asked if you want your information to be recorded for future improvements and whether you would like to
        continue using our services to maintain your economic success.</p>
